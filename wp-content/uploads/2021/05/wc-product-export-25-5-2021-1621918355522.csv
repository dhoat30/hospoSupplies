Very appropriate for fizzy drinks like Champagne! Each Saucer Available in a charming gift box so would make a fantastic gift!! Made by Anton Studio Designs and the glass is coloured so the beautiful effect will never fade! First Launched in 2013, Fizz was an instant hit… and has only risen in popularity over the last few years. Its unique look is thanks to the jewel colours used, the innovative use of bubbles within the glass and making the colours radiate through – especially when filled with liquid. The popularity of this range is further aided by its contemporary shape, and with the flutes, wines, gins and martinis all having elegant long stems. In 2016 we have introduced three new items: two generously sized jugs, in blue and purple, and a fantastic set of four shot glasses. In addition to these, for 2017 we have further grown the range to include a set of four fantastic gin glasses. Most recently in 2018 we have added also a set of four gorgeous champagne saucers.

Because it is reinforced externally with a proprietary stainless-steel alloy. Most coatings are just that: a coating applied over a metal substrate — a surface finish. Excalibur is a system. A matrix of stainless steel is welded to the article, becoming a part of it. The stainless-steel matrix is then impregnated with premium non-stick coatings. The result is a coating system with the toughness of stainless steel and the release properties of the best non-stick. After over 25 years on the market and reigning choice for gourmet cookware around the world, Excalibur has proven that it is in fact the most durable coating system ever created for top-of-stove cookware.
